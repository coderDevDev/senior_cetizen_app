Objectives
The objectives of the researchers’ “Senior Citizen Information Management System and Senior Citizen Registration App” capstone project are the following:
1. To develop a centralized web-based system for OSCA that enables comprehensive record management, benefit tracking, and the ability to add, edit, delete, and manage senior citizen records per barangay, 

as well as 
post announcements, 
alerts, and 
emergency updates relevant to senior citizens.


2. To build a mobile registration application with offline data capture 
and auto-sync functionality to support fieldwork and minimize
connectivity issues, ensuring that data is saved locally 
and automatically synchronized once the device regains internet access.


3. To integrate a real-time SMS notification system that 
sends automatic alerts to registered senior citizens 
and/or their family members for announcements, benefit schedules, 
emergency notices, and other important updates.


4. To develop a senior citizen self-service module,
 accessible via the mobile application, that allows senior
BASC  citizens to log in securely, view their personal records and credentials, request official documents offered by OSCA/A (e.g., IDs, certifications), schedule appointments with Barangay Health Workers (BHW), and request medical assistance or apply for available benefits.
5. To ensure that senior citizens or their families can also
 access a web-based portal to check status updates,
  view announcements, and request corrections or modifications
   to their records for better transparency and participation.
6. To reduce the risk of data loss, duplication, 
and manual encoding errors by at least 80% through the implementation of secure, cloud-based digital record-keeping and validation processes integrated across both the web and mobile systems.
7. To include a built-in census management
 feature that tracks deceased, active, and 
 incoming senior citizens per barangay,
  allowing OSCA to monitor demographic trends 
  and maintain accurate, up-to-date records.
8.To implement a multi-level user access control system, 
where the Superadmin (OSCA) has full system control,
 while Admins (BASCA) have restricted access limited to their assigned barangay,
  ensuring secure, accountable, and efficient task delegation and data privacy.
