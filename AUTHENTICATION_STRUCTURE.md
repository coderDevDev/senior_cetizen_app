# Authentication Structure & File Organization

This document outlines the new authentication structure implemented based on the `features.txt` specifications.

## File Organization

### Authentication Routes (`/auth/*`)

```
client/app/auth/
├── layout.tsx          # Shared auth layout
├── login/
│   └── page.tsx       # Login page with role-based routing
├── register/
│   └── page.tsx       # Registration with role selection
└── forgot-password/
    └── page.tsx       # Password reset functionality
```

### Onboarding Routes

```
client/app/onboarding/
└── vark/
    └── page.tsx       # VARK learning style assessment
```

### Role-Based Dashboards

```
client/app/
├── student/
│   └── dashboard/
│       └── page.tsx   # Student dashboard
└── teacher/
    └── dashboard/
        └── page.tsx   # Teacher dashboard
```

## Authentication Flow

### 1. User Registration

- **Path**: `/auth/register`
- **Features**:
  - Role selection (Student/Teacher)
  - Form validation with Zod
  - Role-based form fields
  - Automatic profile creation in Supabase

### 2. User Login

- **Path**: `/auth/login`
- **Features**:
  - Email/password authentication
  - Role-based redirect logic
  - Error handling and validation

### 3. Role-Based Routing

After successful authentication:

#### For Teachers:

- **Redirect**: `/teacher/dashboard`
- **Access**: Full teacher features immediately

#### For Students:

- **First Time**: `/onboarding/vark` (VARK assessment)
- **After Onboarding**: `/student/dashboard`

### 4. VARK Onboarding (Students Only)

- **Path**: `/onboarding/vark`
- **Features**:
  - 8-question learning style assessment
  - Progress tracking
  - Results display with learning style explanation
  - Automatic profile update
  - Redirect to student dashboard

## Database Integration

The system integrates with the existing Supabase database schema:

- `profiles` table with learning style and onboarding status
- Automatic profile creation on user registration
- Learning style storage and retrieval
- Onboarding completion tracking

## Navigation Structure

```
/ (Landing Page)
├── /auth/login
├── /auth/register
├── /auth/forgot-password
├── /onboarding/vark (Students only)
├── /student/dashboard
└── /teacher/dashboard
```

## Component Reuse

The new structure eliminates the need for:

- `components/login-screen.tsx`
- `components/register-screen.tsx`
- `components/forgot-password-screen.tsx`
- `components/role-selection.tsx`

These are replaced by the new route-based pages in the `app/` directory.

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Route-Based**: Follows Next.js 13+ app router conventions
3. **Role-Based Access**: Proper authentication flow
4. **VARK Integration**: Learning style assessment for students
5. **Maintainable**: Easier to add new features
6. **Scalable**: Clear structure for future development

## Next Steps

1. **Implement API Integration**: Connect with Supabase backend
2. **Add Protected Routes**: Middleware for authentication
3. **Complete Dashboards**: Add actual functionality
4. **Testing**: User flow testing and validation
5. **Additional Features**: Lessons, quizzes, activities management
